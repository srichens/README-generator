# README Generator

## Bootcamp Challenge Week 9
This week's challenge was to write a command-line application to generate a professional README file with the following requirements:
1. Invoke the app using node.js.
2. Use the inquirer package.
3. Using the question prompts from inquirer, gather the user's project title, installation instructions, usage guidelines, license used, contributors and contribution guidelines, testing information, and email and github profile to be used in a questions section.
4. Include a Table of Contents that links to each section of the README
4. From the user's license input, generate a badge at the top of the README that links to the license webpage. The user should be allowed to not choose a license, so if a license isn't chosen, there are no errors; the badge just isn't created.
6. From the user's license input, generate a license section in the README. If a license isn't chosen, the license section does not appear.
